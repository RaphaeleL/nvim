# NaaVim

<b>Useable for </b>
macOS · Linux · Windows

> **NaaVim** is my Personal `nvim` Configuration for daily usage that works completely fine on Linux, MacOS and Windows. **NaaVim** is a complete IDE layer for `nvim` and easily customizable. It includes some useful plugins, but not everything the `nvim` Community provides, for example no dap. Uhh and it's Lazy Loading the Plugins, so the startup time is *Blazyingly Fast*.

## Install

> Neovim 0.10.0

You can install `nvim` using a package manager, but keep in mind that `nvim` may be updated to a newer version when you update packages. This can lead to a plugin suddenly not working anymore.

If you want to make sure `nvim` is only updated when you want, then installing it from source.

Clone the Repository into `.config/` and start `nvim`. The Configuration is Installing every Plugin, Language Server and Syntax Highlighting automatically.

```bash 
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/RaphaeleL/nvim
```

## Uninstall 

```bash 
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
```
